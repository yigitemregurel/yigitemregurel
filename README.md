### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a backend developer, I have experience in technologies like Python, PL/SQL, and PostgreSQL. 
Through my work with data visualization, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, I have demonstrated the ability to present data in meaningful ways and possess skills in database systems and API integration.


You don't have to be afraid, you can walk around as you want :)
